//! Handler registration — pairs route metadata with a type-erased Axum handler.
//!
//! The `#[orpc]` macro emits two `inventory::submit!` calls per handler:
//! 1. `HandlerMetadata` — for codegen (TypeScript contract)
//! 2. `HandlerRegistration` — for runtime (Axum router construction)
//!
//! ## State erasure
//!
//! Handlers that extract `State<T>` produce `MethodRouter<T>` which can't be
//! stored in a `static` alongside handlers with different state types.
//!
//! Solution: the factory receives the concrete state value as `Box<dyn Any + Send + Sync>`
//! and downcasts it internally, returning a fully state-erased `Router<()>`.
//! Each handler's factory knows its own state type `S` at macro expansion time.
